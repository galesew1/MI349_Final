            <h2>Who am I</h2>
            <p> My name is Ryan Galesewicz and I am a senior at Michigan State University. My major is in games and interactive media with a focus in game design. G3 studios is an indie video game company created by myself. I have been a fan of video games my whole life and wanted to create my own video games. G3 studios is a company i created so i can share my games with others.

            <h2>My goal</h2>
            <p> My goal is to create a unique experience for the audience. I want to create retro style games that have a twist to appeal to a new audience. One thing that makes my games unique is the technical movement required to complaete my games. I enjoy creating platformers that have very high difficulty. The games are all very difficult to complete and will provide a challenge to players of all skill levels. </p>

            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>I currently have 3 games and a basic simulation created and published. I plan on creating more games sometime in early 2023. My games are created using the program <em>Unity</em> and the assets for the game were provided by Michigan State University. The games artwork is from the class CAS 117. The level design and some color changes are designed by myself to give the games a unique feeling</p>
